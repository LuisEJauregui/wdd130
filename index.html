        <p>Hello, I am Luis Jauregui, from Juarez city, Chihuahua Mexico, I live right in the border of el paso Texas. I am currently studying and I would like to become a web developer</p>
        <p>A little about me, I love sports specially Basketball, soccer, football, Box, Hockey etc, but I enjoy practicing them more than watching, except for the boxing and UFC, those I only watch! ðŸ¤£
            I love spending time with family, I enjoy repairing stuff and figuring out how things work, I love helping others and serving. I am currently serving as a 2nd conselor of the stake presidency, and love working with the new generation.
